Descriptive statistics such as Measures of Central Tendency and Spread were also applied to the data to improve our understanding of the data set. These measurements were displayed using visualization techniques such as those listed in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 showcases a pivot table that presents the outcomes of the theater data depending on the start month along with a corresponding line with a markers plot to make trends easier to visualize. Figure 3 demonstrates a box and whiskers plot that visually shows the spread of campaign funds for the goal and pledge data.
